# Notes on running

## Environmental variables

The following environmental variables are recommended to be set before running the code.

```
LB_DB_HOST=databasehost
LB_DB_USER=username
LB_DB_PASS=password
LB_DB_PORT=databaseport
LB_DB_NAME=databasename
INPUT_LOGS_PATH=pathtoinput
```

An easy way to do so is include them in exactly this manner in a `.env` file in the main project directory.

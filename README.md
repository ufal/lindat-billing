[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ufal/lindat-billing.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ufal/lindat-billing)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Run ```npm install```
3. Create a database in postgres and update *database-setup.sh* accordingly
4. Make sure the database has the *pgcrypto* extension
5. Run ```database-setup.sh```
6. Either use a "secrets file" or environmental variables, see section [Configuration](#Configuration)
6. Run ```npm start```


## Configuration

### Secrets file

### Environmental variables

If the database is run on the standard port 5432 on localhost, you 
need to configure only the following variables:

* ```LB_DB_USER``` - database username 
* ```LB_DB_PASS``` - database password 
* ```LB_DB_NAME``` - database name 



## Development

### Logging

To see debug logs define ```DEBUG=*``` environmental variable.



## Other tools

### pre-commit

Install pre-commit (http://pre-commit.com/) and execute
```
pre-commit install
```

### lint

Run and fix
```
npm run lint
```

# Deployment

## ufal-point-dev

Initial:
1. create new user (node), copy ssh keys
2. ``` pm2 deploy pm2.json ufal-point-dev setup ```
3. ``` pm2 deploy pm2.json ufal-point-dev ```
4. create database and secrets file or ENV variables
5. setup proxy, careful with '/' at the end, expecting relative paths to node


## Additional scripts

**create-admin-account.sh**

Adds a new user with admin privileges.
```
sh create-admin-account.sh PORT DBNAME USERNAME PASSWORD
```
- _PORT_ The port where the database runs.
- _DBNAME_ Database name.
- _USERNAME_ Username to be added.
- _PASSWORD_ Password for the new admin.

**fill-database.sh**

Adds some user-related data do the database.
```
sh fill-database.sh PORT DBNAME
```
- _PORT_ The port where the database runs.
- _DBNAME_ Database name.

# Notes on running

## Environmental variables

The following environmental variables are recommended to be set before running the code.

```
LB_DB_HOST=databasehost
LB_DB_USER=username
LB_DB_PASS=password
LB_DB_PORT=databaseport
LB_DB_NAME=databasename
INPUT_LOGS_PATH=pathtoinput
SECRETS_FILE_PATH=pathtosecretsfile
RESET_LOGS=true / false
ACCESS_LOG_ONLY=true / false
```

An easy way to do so is include them in exactly this manner in a `.env` file in the main project directory.
